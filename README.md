# kubernetesjourney
This repo serves to document my learning of Docker/Kubernetes.
Also in hopes that anyone who comes behind me can follow my instructions and easily learn as well.

Initially I set out to learn Kubernetes and just purely document my learning journey in this repo, now I've decided to pivot from that decision and actually make this repo a mix of automated process, it will include the following:
   - Deploy AWS EKS using Terraform 
   - Automate & Deploy K8 resources using manifest files
   - Deploy an application
   - Possibly deploy ArgoCD
   - To Be Continued....

Journey So far:
 1. See /terraform/ folder for the resources deployed into AWS:
    - EKS Cluster
    - IAM Resources
 2. Will begin on building manifest files
    - Deployment 
    - Ingress Controller
    - Persistent Volume 
    - Persistent Volume Claim 
    Later I may figure out how to automate this my self
